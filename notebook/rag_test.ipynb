       "  'Doctor': 'Hi there ~The abdominal pain and weight loss may be related to your H pylori tests coming back as negative.  I think that you have seen a GI doctor and the endoscopy and biopsy results are normal.  I am sure the GI doctor prescribed medications that were related to assumed gastritis as it is the most common cause of your symptoms.   I think you might need more investigations if the symptoms do not get better soon.  I also think that you might want to try some pain medications over the counter.  Sometimes symptoms are psychological and relieving your anxiety might make things better for you.  I believe you should find a good doctor that will help with treating your anxiety with psychotropic medications.  I hope this helps.Take care and have a lovely day!'},\n",

I still have a persistent tickle in my throat and gag on phlegm when I lay down. Can I take a benedryl?  Will it help?  Also is it ok to take the predisione like that without weening off?

       "  'Doctor': 'Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions to you:1. If you have such complaints repeatedly, I would think of asthma. If you have such symptoms for the first time, I would not think of asthma straightway.2. Were I treating you, I would add an antihistamine (like Benadryl) in your treatment, your current treatment does not have any antihistamine. So you can take a benadryl. However, Benadryl causes sedation, I would suggest you to take levocetirizine.3. Personally I would not suggest you dextromethorphan (a content in Robitussin DM) if you have wheezing. I would instead prescribe you salbutamol or levosalbutamol.4. Your doctor is the best judge to decide whether you need steroids (Prednisone). So, if you have been prescribed them, I would suggest you to take them as suggested by your doctor. 5-day course of prednisone is considered a \"short course\" and it does not require weaning off.5. As you have musuc ticking into throat, I would also think of acute or chronic sinusitis. Some of the above medications will help the sinusitis also, I would in addition suggest you to take plenty of warm fluids during day and regular steam inhalation which will help.6. If you have been having these symptoms repeatedly, I would think of allergies and asthma. In that case, I would add montelukast to above treatment. For long term management, I would suggest you allergy testing first, which will help you identify the substances causing symptoms to you and also to know the measures to avoid them.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health and a very good recovery.Thank you & Regards.'}]"

       "  'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I sprang my ankle four days ago and went to the ER and they did an x-ray and of course, they could only tell me if there were any major fractures or breaks because of the swelling. Now the swelling has gone down a lot but just a little remain. Hardly there is any bruising, but it is still sore, and when I run the top of my foot (when I take the walking boot off to shower) my two middle toes tingle.

       "  'Doctor': 'Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Yes, you should go to the clinic and see an orthopedic surgeon because after the swelling and pain reduces they can evaluate you better to find a cause. That is if there is any major ligament injury or no, or if it has sprained. The tingling can be due to small nerves getting pinched due to the swelling. So do not worry about that it will reduce. What you need is to wear an ankle stirrup brace, which is light and it will protect your ankle in the healing phase so that the sprained ligaments heal faster. Also, if you have sprained your ankle so many times then you need to do is to strengthen the muscles of your leg, i.e. extensors and flexors of the leg so that it does not happen again. Once you strengthen these muscles it will protect your ankle joint. Also, use an elastocrepe bandage of six inches width from the toes to just below the knee to reduce the swelling. Follow up sos.'},\n",

From the context, it appears that this could potentially be related to an injury to a blood vessel or a local injury. The significant bleeding you mentioned, especially if it happens multiple times, raises some concern for underlying issues, such as an abnormality in blood coagulation.\\n\\nCommon causes for such a maroonish dot could include:\\n\\n- **Injury**: If something sharp penetrated the skin, it could have damaged a blood vessel, leading to the bleeding.\\n- **Sebaceous Cyst**: In some cases, a cyst could form under the skin that may become inflamed and bleed.\\n- **Capillary Hemangioma**: A benign vascular tumor that can appear as a red or maroon spot.\\n\\nGiven that the area has not healed and is still troubling you, it is very wise that you have scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist. They will be able to examine the area properly and could perform necessary tests to rule out any serious conditions.\\n\\nAt this point, it is best to avoid attempting any home remedies that could exacerbate the situation. Persistent symptoms such as these should be evaluated in person by a healthcare professional. If you notice any additional symptoms like increased redness, swelling, or pain, or if you develop new spots, be sure to inform your doctor. \\n\\nTake care, and I hope you find relief soon.',\n",
