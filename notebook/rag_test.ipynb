Especially if you didn't take care of it after it happened. For example, after the injury of joints the best thing to do is to insert the joint in cold water and then to rap it up with onion and salt in order to suck and remove the fluids causing edema of the joint. If this is not done the fluids coming out because of the injury will be swolled and hurting. The ankle neess to rest as well but you say your daughter continues to move around thereafter. Therefore, after aome days in this conditions with fluid in the joint space the inflamation could occur leading to fever. However this is little probable if the skin is intact (not perdorated or torn out) as microbes dont have an entry point. My asvice: try to treat the ankle with grilled onion mixed with salt and rapping it with a piece of clothing or bandages and give paracetamol to lower the temperature. If the situation does not improve then you have to see a doctor.Best!\"}]"

One such condition is recurrent allergy associated sinusitis.

It is always better to take adequate care and precautionary measures must be followed at all costs failing which you not only expose yourself but expose others as well.

I think that you have seen a GI doctor and the endoscopy and biopsy results are normal.

I think you might need more investigations if the symptoms do not get better soon.  I also think that you might want to try some pain medications over the counter.  Sometimes symptoms are psychological and relieving your anxiety might make things better for you.

       "  'Doctor': 'Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions to you:1. If you have such complaints repeatedly, I would think of asthma. If you have such symptoms for the first time, I would not think of asthma straightway.2. Were I treating you, I would add an antihistamine (like Benadryl) in your treatment, your current treatment does not have any antihistamine. So you can take a benadryl. However, Benadryl causes sedation, I would suggest you to take levocetirizine.3. Personally I would not suggest you dextromethorphan (a content in Robitussin DM) if you have wheezing. I would instead prescribe you salbutamol or levosalbutamol.4. Your doctor is the best judge to decide whether you need steroids (Prednisone). So, if you have been prescribed them, I would suggest you to take them as suggested by your doctor. 5-day course of prednisone is considered a \"short course\" and it does not require weaning off.5. As you have musuc ticking into throat, I would also think of acute or chronic sinusitis. Some of the above medications will help the sinusitis also, I would in addition suggest you to take plenty of warm fluids during day and regular steam inhalation which will help.6. If you have been having these symptoms repeatedly, I would think of allergies and asthma. In that case, I would add montelukast to above treatment. For long term management, I would suggest you allergy testing first, which will help you identify the substances causing symptoms to you and also to know the measures to avoid them.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health and a very good recovery.Thank you & Regards.'}]"

       "  'Doctor': 'Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Yes, you should go to the clinic and see an orthopedic surgeon because after the swelling and pain reduces they can evaluate you better to find a cause. That is if there is any major ligament injury or no, or if it has sprained. The tingling can be due to small nerves getting pinched due to the swelling. So do not worry about that it will reduce. What you need is to wear an ankle stirrup brace, which is light and it will protect your ankle in the healing phase so that the sprained ligaments heal faster. Also, if you have sprained your ankle so many times then you need to do is to strengthen the muscles of your leg, i.e. extensors and flexors of the leg so that it does not happen again. Once you strengthen these muscles it will protect your ankle joint. Also, use an elastocrepe bandage of six inches width from the toes to just below the knee to reduce the swelling.
