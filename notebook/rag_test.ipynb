Nothing to worry if she is otherwise playful and taking feeds. Get back to doctor if fever does not subside by then, headache is sever or vomiting persists. Hope I have answered your query.

Please suggest whether I should continue with the medicine or change the course. My weight is 90 kg. I do not have nasal block or sore throat. I only have headache and body ache.',\n",
       "  'Doctor': 'Hello. If you are having fever for three to four days and not having any improvement, then do one blood test CBC with MP (complete blood count with metabolic panel) and one urine routine test. From history it looks like you have viral fever. If the platelet count is low in the report, then you have to do a test for dengue. Also, look at white blood cell count (WBC). If it is increased, then you have to take a higher dose of antibiotic along with some other antibiotic. If it is low, then it is some other viral fever. In that case continue your medication, take Paracetamol for fever and do sponging if the fever did not subside. If you are more uncomfortable, then get admitted and take proper nursing care. In viral fever, we can give only supportive therapy as there is no definite treatment for it. Antibiotics in viral fever will just help to avoid another infection as your immunity will be low due to fever. Also, Augmentin 325 is pediatric dose (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid). You should increase the dose of Augmentin 625. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. For further information consult a general practitioner online -->'},\n",

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (Maximum ceiling dose 500mg per dose) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.
