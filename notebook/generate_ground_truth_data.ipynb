      "Doctor: Hello, I have studied your case. Due to compression of this nerve root there is pain in your back and chest.Due to occlusion of vessels there can be pain sensation.I will advise you to do MRI thoracic spine, HRCT [CHEST] and EMG- NCV [nerve conduction study]For these symptoms analgesic and neurotropic medication can be started.Till time, avoid lifting weights, Sit with support to back. You can consult physiotherapist for help.Physiotherapy like ultrasound and interferential therapy will give quick relief.I will advise to check your vit B12 and vit D3 level.Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health.Take care.\n",
